      As a first-generation Korean American, my life has been a journey of
      resilience, adaptation, and personal growth. I moved to the United States
      in the third grade, a transition that required me to learn a new language
      and culture. Each subsequent relocation presented its own challenges, but
      these experiences have shaped me, teaching me the value of friendship and
      community.

      In 2020, my career as a software developer was put on pause due to the
      pandemic. This unforeseen event became a period of self-reflection and
      personal development. After graduating from University of Pittsburgh, my
      parents moved back to Korea. After being unable to visit them for a few
      years, I decided to reconnect with my family, having conversations I
      couldn't have as a kid growing up in the States and deepening my
      understanding of my roots.

      I found joy in unexpected places. I rescued a kitten from the streets.
      Having never had pets before, I am learning my responsibilities and
      grateful for a new sense of companionship in my life. I traveled and
      assisted my aunt and uncle with their restaurant business in Dallas. I
      also achieved personal milestones such as obtaining my driver's license
      and being the best man at a wedding. Towards the end of this period, I had
      the unique opportunity to fly to Korea to interview for a graduate program
      in cybersecurity at Korea University. Although I didn't get in, it was a
      valuable experience that allowed me to explore a new academic path.

      Technology has been a constant companion throughout my life. From using a
      PC since Windows 95, to building desktop computers for friends and family,
      to marveling at the vast capabilities of the internet, my fascination with
      technology has remained steadfast. I am eager to apply the skills I've
      acquired, the stability I've developed, and the passion I've reignited to
      contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. I am ready to embark
      on this next chapter of my journey and look forward to the opportunities
      it will bring.
