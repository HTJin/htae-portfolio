# Overnight session — tasks (overnight-tasks-2026-08-05.md)

> **For the executing agent:** You're picking this up fresh. This document is your entire brief. Read it top to bottom, follow the operating rules, work the tasks in order, log to `overnight-log-2026-08-05.md`, journal to `overnight-journal-2026-08-05.md`, and rewrite `overnight-report-2026-08-05.md` at the end of every cycle. This run **loops** Suggester -> Planner -> Critic -> Builder -> Reviewer autonomously and endlessly until the user stops it. If something is ambiguous, make the most reasonable documented assumption and keep moving — do **not** stop and wait for a human.

**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Goal of the night (one line):** Make `/drive` feel like sitting in a real car built by a software engineer — a believable driver's-POV cockpit, an arrival panel worth reading, and project screenshots that display in full and cycle themselves.
**Phase:** Planner
**Cycle:** 3

## Project orientation (so a fresh agent can start cold)

- **Stack:** Next.js 13 (pages router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, framer-motion, CSS modules. JS (not TS) — `jsconfig.json`, `@/` -> `src/`.
- **Install:** `npm install`
- **Run:** `npm run dev` — NOTE: port 3000 is already occupied on this machine, Next falls back to **http://localhost:3001**. Always confirm the port from the dev-server log before browsing.
- **Test:** no test suite in `package.json` (scripts are dev / dev:fresh / build / start / lint / prettier). Verification is therefore **`npm run build` + real browser exercise via the Claude Chrome extension**.
- **Build / lint:** `npm run build`, `npm run lint`
- **Where the relevant code lives:**
  - `src/pages/drive.jsx` — the drive-mode page
  - `src/components/drive/DriveScene.jsx` — composition root (Sky, RoadCanvas, ExitSign, CarInterior, StopCard, Dashboard, RouteMap, Ignition)
  - `src/components/drive/CarInterior.jsx` — glass, pillars, headliner, mirror, wipers
  - `src/components/drive/Dashboard.jsx` — gauges, steering wheel, trip computer, console buttons, pedals
  - `src/components/drive/StopCard.jsx` — the panel that opens on arrival at a stop
  - `src/components/drive/route.js` — builds the itinerary from `src/content/*`
  - `src/components/drive/RoadCanvas.jsx` / `world.js` / `useDrive.js` — the driving sim
  - `src/styles/drive.module.css` — `.hud`, `.dash`, `.glass`, `.pillarLeft/Right`, `.star`, `.ignition`, `.blink`
  - `src/lib/projects.js` — project data incl. `screenshots: ['/1.png', ...]`; files live at `public/images/projects/<name>/<n>.png`
- **Glossary:** *stop* = one exit on the route (a job, a project, education, the toolbox, the destination). *parked* = the car is stationary at a stop, which is when `StopCard` shows. *leg* = a named group of stops (Career highway, Scenic overlook, Pit stop…).

## Operating rules (how to run this list)

- **Never block.** Unclear → assume, log the assumption, continue. There is no human.
- **Check before building.** Search the code first; finish half-built things rather than forking a second version.
- **Verify it actually works.** `npm run build` must pass AND the change must be seen working in the real browser at `/drive`.
- **Commit per task**, locally, with a clear message.
- **Resolve every task — never leave it `[ ]`.** `[x]` = built & self-verified, *pending the auto-Reviewer*; otherwise move it to **Needs testing / Awaiting scenario / Blocked / Needs human**. Only the Reviewer phase writes **Done**.

## Guardrails (THIS BLOCK IS THE LAW — permissive by default)

**Authorized actions:** commit locally to the current branch `feat/drive-mode`; create files under `src/` and the repo root for the overnight logs; run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run prettier`; read/write any file under `src/`, `public/images/`, `src/styles/`; kill and restart the dev server; drive the local site in Chrome via the extension; add SVG/CSS assets authored in-repo.
**Prohibited actions:** do NOT push to any remote; do NOT merge to `main`; do NOT open/modify PRs; do NOT deploy (no Vercel/`vercel` CLI); do NOT install new npm dependencies (work with what is already in `package.json`); do NOT touch `.env.local`, `.git/config`, or anything under `.git/`; do NOT delete or overwrite the user's screenshot PNGs in `public/images/projects/`; do NOT modify `src/content/*.js` or `src/lib/projects.js` factual content (adding a *derived/optional* field is allowed, rewriting the user's copy is not); do NOT touch the Supabase MCP project.
**Hard floors (always on):** (1) never trigger an interactive permission/approval prompt — park such tasks as **Needs human**. (2) never take an irreversible/unrecoverable action unless explicitly authorized above.
**Scope — only touch:** `src/components/drive/**`, `src/styles/drive.module.css`, `src/pages/drive.jsx`, and (read-only) `src/lib/projects.js` / `src/content/**`. New drive-only components may be added under `src/components/drive/`.
**Do NOT touch:** the classic site sections (`src/components/sections/**`), `src/content/**` copy, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `package.json`. NOTE: the working tree already had uncommitted modifications to `src/components/sections/*` and `src/content/*` **before this run started** — leave them alone, and never `git add -A`; stage only the drive-mode files this run touches.

**Pre-mortem guardrails (prevent likely failure modes):**
1. *Failure: hydration mismatch.* The gauges already round coordinates to keep SSR and client byte-identical (`Dashboard.jsx:11-17`). Any new SVG geometry computed with `Math.*` must be rounded the same way, and nothing may branch on `window`/`Date` during render. **Guardrail:** after every visual change, check the browser console for a hydration warning before calling the task built.
2. *Failure: the 60fps loop gets slower.* The sim pushes state via `drive.subscribe(...)` and writes to refs, deliberately bypassing React re-renders. **Guardrail:** never add per-frame React state to the drive loop; new live readouts must use the `subscribe` + `ref.textContent`/`style.transform` pattern already in `Dashboard.jsx:32-45`.
3. *Failure: the cockpit eats the road.* Making the dash taller/denser can crowd the windshield until there is nothing to look at. **Guardrail:** the drivable glass area must stay >= ~50% of viewport height at 900px tall, and the dash must not exceed ~38% height; verify visually at 1440x900 AND 390x844.
4. *Failure: a redesigned StopCard becomes unreadable or unscrollable on mobile.* **Guardrail:** verify the panel at 390x844 — content must scroll, no horizontal overflow, and the close/next affordances must stay reachable.
5. *Failure: the screenshot carousel autoplays over reduced-motion users, or leaks timers between stops.* **Guardrail:** honor `useReducedMotion()` (show a static first frame + manual dots), and clear the interval on unmount/stop-change; verify by switching stops repeatedly and watching for stacked timers.
6. *Failure: running `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is live, or trusting a poisoned `.next` cache.* They share `.next`; the build clobbers the dev server's route manifest (`/drive` starts 404ing for new requests while the open tab keeps working off HMR). Worse, the webpack cache can go stale and **silently serve CSS that is missing newly-added Tailwind classes** — observed in cycle 2, where `line-clamp-2` and `lg:truncate` produced zero CSS rules until a clean restart. **Guardrail:** after any `npm run build`, restart the dev server; and if a class looks inert, run `npm run dev:fresh` (wipes `.next`) and re-check *before* concluding the class or the config is at fault.
7. *Failure: mistaking a hidden Chrome window for a broken page.* A backgrounded tab reports `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`; Chrome then unrenders it, so screenshots come back solid black and every `getBoundingClientRect()` returns 0. **Guardrail:** before reporting any visual defect, check `document.hidden` first — if true, the finding is worthless, and verification must fall back to build/lint until a person foregrounds Chrome.
8. *Failure: `object-contain` fixes cropping but leaves ugly letterbox bars.* **Guardrail:** the frame must have an intentional backing (browser-chrome mock) so unused space reads as design, not as a bug.
9. *Failure (cycle 2): the time-of-day palette allocates per frame and drags the 60fps loop down.* `paletteAt()` would run inside the canvas paint, building fresh objects and gradient strings 60x a second. **Guardrail:** mutate one module-level palette object in place, quantise progress before rebuilding any gradient string, and re-check that driving still feels smooth afterwards.
10. *Failure (cycle 2): `Sky` starts re-rendering React per frame.* It is currently pure static markup. **Guardrail:** it must stay a `drive.subscribe` + refs component exactly like `Dashboard`; no `useState` may be driven by the sim.
11. *Failure (cycle 2): hydration mismatch from a progress-dependent sky.* Server markup must match the client's first paint. **Guardrail:** the server renders the palette at progress = 0, with no `Math.random`/`Date` at render time; all motion happens in effects afterwards.
12. *Failure (cycle 2): a brighter dusk sky washes out the HUD or the exit signs.* **Guardrail:** check `StopCard` legibility and exit-sign contrast at the brightest point of the cycle (MILE 0), not only at night.

## Decisions & assumptions locked in

- **The three user-stated priorities come first, in this order:** (1) car interior dashboard should look like a real car from the driver's POV; (2) the arrival panel (`StopCard`) needs work; (3) project photos are cut off and should auto-cycle with a smooth fade. Creative identity work is welcome but must not displace these.
- **Creative direction (chosen this run, documented so later cycles stay coherent):** *"the engineer's cockpit."* The owner is a Senior MES DevOps Engineer — hands-on with data, servers, and factory-floor hardware. The car is therefore an **instrument-dense telemetry machine**, not a luxury sedan: a hooded binnacle, real warning-light row, a centre screen that reads like a terminal, amber + terminal-green accents alongside the existing sky-blue. Restraint over gimmicks — every added element should either read as a real car part or as a developer's signature, not both at once.
- **Driver geometry assumption:** the camera is the driver's eyes in a left-hand-drive car. Therefore the steering wheel belongs on the driver's axis (slightly left of viewport centre, ~44-47%), the instrument binnacle sits *behind and above* the wheel so it reads through the wheel's upper aperture, and the centre stack sits to the **right** of the wheel. Observed defect: the wheel currently sits at ~33% of viewport width while the road's vanishing point is at 50%, and the cluster floats to the wheel's right at dash level rather than in a binnacle — which is why it does not read as a car.
- **Evidence for "photos get cut off":** `src/components/drive/StopCard.jsx:52-57` renders `<img className="mt-3 h-28 w-full ... object-cover object-top sm:h-36">` — a fixed ~7rem/9rem strip with `object-cover`, so a full-page screenshot is hard-cropped to its top band. Verified in the browser at EXIT 11 (Solar Power Indy): only the top ~25% of the screenshot is visible.
- **Evidence for "no cycling":** `src/components/drive/route.js:81-83` maps only `project.screenshots[0]` into `stop.image`. `src/lib/projects.js` has 2-5 screenshots per project (e.g. `solar-indy` has 4) and the files exist on disk under `public/images/projects/<name>/`. So the other screenshots are never reachable in drive mode.
- **Evidence for the panel/mirror collision:** at 1440x900 the `StopCard` (top-[13%]) renders over the rear-view mirror (top-[6.5%], `CarInterior.jsx:26-36`) — verified in the browser, the mirror's "BEHIND YOU" text sits partly behind the panel's top edge.
- **No test suite exists**, so "verified" means `npm run build` passes *and* the behaviour was observed in Chrome. Do not fabricate a test run.
- **Do not add npm dependencies.** framer-motion, clsx and Tailwind are already present and are sufficient.

## Carried forward (from prior runs)

- *(none — cycle 1 is the first)*

## Tonight's tasks (in order)

*(cycle 2's list is fully resolved — see Done. The Planner fills this for cycle 3 from the Backlog below.)*

<details>
<summary>Cycle 2's list (resolved — kept for context)</summary>

### CYCLE 2

The user's three stated priorities all shipped in cycle 1. Cycle 2 spends its budget on the standing brief — *"get
creative, capture my identity as a software developer and the purpose of this portfolio"* — starting with the single
biggest lever available: making the drive pass **time**, not just distance.

- [ ] **1. Time-of-day lighting that advances along the route** (backlog S6)
  - **Why:** the route is a career in chronological order — school, nine roles, the side builds, the destination — but
    every frame currently looks identical, so the drive reads as a loop rather than a journey. Changing the light as
    you travel is the one change that touches every pixel and makes the metaphor land: you can *see* time passing.
  - **Direction (decided, so later cycles stay coherent):** do **not** do a full day cycle — the existing art is
    night-tuned (stars, moon, sodium lamp glow, neon HUD) and a washed-out midday would destroy it. Instead run a
    narrow, rich band: **golden-hour dusk at MILE 0 -> deepening twilight across the career highway -> full night by
    the toolbox**, then let the *destination* carry the first hint of dawn on the horizon. Dusk-to-night keeps the
    aesthetic; the dawn hint at "You have arrived" earns the "next chapter" note without being heavy-handed.
  - **Files:** new `src/components/drive/daylight.js` (keyframe palette + `paletteAt(progress)`), `RoadCanvas.jsx`
    (replace the frozen `COLORS` table), `Sky.jsx` (becomes subscription-driven), `DriveScene.jsx` (pass `drive` to
    `Sky`), possibly `drive.module.css`.
  - **Evidence it is currently static:** `RoadCanvas.jsx:17-27` is a module-level `COLORS` constant used directly in
    `draw()`; `Sky.jsx:24-90` renders a fixed `linear-gradient(#03060d -> #14405f)`, a fixed moon at `left:14% top:9%`
    and 110 deterministic stars — nothing in either file reads the sim.
  - **Done when:** driving from MILE 0 to the destination visibly changes sky, tarmac, verge and lamp warmth; stars and
    moon fade in as night falls; the destination shows the dawn hint; the paint loop still runs smoothly (guardrail 9);
    `Sky` uses subscribe+refs, not state (guardrail 10); and a cold load has no hydration warning (guardrail 11).
- [ ] **2. Exit-sign realism pass** (backlog S9)
  - **Why:** the signs anchor the whole road-trip conceit and are what you read at every stop, but they are a plain
    green box on a single post. Real interstate guide signs have an exit-number plaque, twin supports, and a
    retroreflective face that lights up as headlights reach it — which also makes each approach feel like arriving.
  - **Files:** `src/components/drive/ExitSign.jsx`, `drive.module.css`.
  - **Evidence:** `ExitSign.jsx:78-91` — one rounded green panel (`bg-[#12603c]`, `border-white/90`) plus a single
    12px post; no exit plaque, no retroreflection, and a fixed colour that will not sit correctly against the new dusk
    palette from task 1.
  - **Done when:** the sign carries an exit-number plaque, twin posts, and a face that brightens as it nears the
    camera, and it reads correctly at both the dusk and night ends of the task-1 palette.
- [ ] **3. Deep-link a specific exit — `/drive?exit=11`** (backlog S10) *(stretch; returns to Backlog if cycle 2 runs long)*
  - **Why:** drive mode has one URL for 21 stops, so the owner cannot send a recruiter straight to the role or build
    that matters — the main practical use of this page.
  - **Files:** `src/pages/drive.jsx`, `DriveScene.jsx` (read the query on mount, jump via the existing `goTo`).
  - **Done when:** `/drive?exit=11` starts parked at EXIT 11 with its panel open, junk/out-of-range values fall back to
    MILE 0 without throwing, and the URL tracks the current exit so it can be copied.

## Done (proven by the autonomous Reviewer)

- **1. Expose every project screenshot to the route** — proven working: `route.js` project stops carry `images[]`; in Chrome at `/drive` the carousel counter read `1/4` at EXIT 11 (solar-indy, 4 files on disk) and `5/5` at EXIT 12 (matrimoni-react, 5 files on disk). Commit `8883aaa`.
- **2. Auto-cycling project screenshots that are not cut off** — proven working: the full Solar Power Indy capture rendered edge to edge inside the browser frame (previously only its top ~25% was visible), and successive screenshots showed the counter advance 4/4 -> 1/4 -> 2/4 -> 3/4 unaided, with the active dot tracking it. Commit `8883aaa`.
- **3. Rebuilt arrival panel** — proven working: exit shield + leg + counter header and the media|prose split rendered at 1920x895; the panel's top edge sits at y=118 with the rear-view mirror ending at y=100, so the overlap reported in the audit is gone. Commit `8883aaa`.
- **4. Cockpit rebuilt around driver geometry** — proven working: at 1920x895 the wheel is centred on the binnacle on the driver's axis with the cluster read over the rim, and a live driving frame showed 35 MPH with the tach up, `P R N D 3` with D lit, the CRUISE tell-tale lit under autopilot, and the terminal screen counting down `EXIT 12 · Matrimoni  0.1 MI`. Commit `646b717`.
- **4b. Phone cockpit** — proven working: at 386x840 the stacked layout (cluster strip / terminal / controls+pedals) rendered correctly with `scrollWidth === innerWidth` (no horizontal overflow) and every control inside the viewport. Commit `646b717`.
- **5a. Cold-load hydration check** *(cleared cycle 2)* — proven clean: console tracking attached and cleared **before** navigating, then `/drive` loaded cold. Zero messages matched `hydrat|did not match|Warning|Error|Uncaught|mismatch`.
- **5b. Title clamping at phone width** *(cleared cycle 2)* — proven working, and it exposed a real cache fault on the way (see the log). At 386x840 on EXIT 11 the h2 computes `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`, `-webkit-box-orient: vertical`, `overflow: hidden`; the real title renders on exactly 2 lines unclipped, and an injected 113-character title still renders at exactly 2 lines (45px = 2 x 22.5px line-height) with `scrollHeight > clientHeight` — i.e. genuinely clamped, not merely short enough.
- **C2-1. Time-of-day lighting along the route** — proven working. Live state read at four points: MILE 0 `starOpacity=0` with a warm `rgb(226,140,84)` horizon; Coding Temple `0.2303`; Weather Window `0.9475`; destination `0.6` (dawn dims them again). Screenshots confirm golden-hour dusk at MILE 0, full night at the toolbox, first light at the destination. Performance measured both ways rather than assumed: **34.2fps median with the palette vs 26.6fps at baseline** (same machine, same 180-frame method, baseline obtained by stashing only the cycle-2 drive files) — no regression. Cold load has no hydration warning. Commit `dd4b28b`.
- **C2-2. Exit-sign realism pass** — proven working: mid-approach at dusk the sign shows its MUTCD exit plaque, twin posts, leg name, live distance countdown ("38 M"), title and sub, with the retroreflective face flaring as it nears; frozen mid-approach at night (brake held) it keeps good contrast against the dark sky. Commit `86d0174`.
- **C2-3. Deep-link an exit** — proven working: `/drive?exit=11` opens parked on Solar Power Indy with the panel up and the carousel at 1/4; driving on moved the URL to `?exit=12`; `?exit=999` falls back to the ignition screen at MILE 0 without throwing. The accept predicate was additionally exercised across `11/0/20/21/999/-3/banana/11abc/" 11 "/1.5/""/1e3/null/0x5` — only in-range integers accepted. Commit `0d3e493`.
- **5c. Reduced-motion path through the carousel** *(cleared cycle 2)* — proven by real execution: `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` was patched to report `matches: true` inside a 390px probe frame before hydration, then EXIT 11 was opened. The frame counter held at `1/4` across 11 seconds (autoplay would have advanced 2-3 times at the 4.2s interval), clicking the third dot still moved it `1/4 -> 3/4`, and the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .shot { transition: none } }` rule is present in the served stylesheet.

## Needs testing (testable now — Reviewer must clear all of these each run)

*(empty — all three cycle-1 items were cleared at the top of cycle 2; see Done 5a/5b/5c.)*

## Awaiting scenario (can't test until a specific scenario occurs)

*(empty — the "foregrounded Chrome" condition arrived at 20:31 local on 2026-08-05 (`hidden=false`, `visibilityState=visible`, dash measured 322px) and the item was cleared.)*

## Blocked (couldn't be implemented — missing dependency the loop can't supply)

*(empty)*

## Needs human (parked — requires a person; the loop will NOT guess these)

*(empty)*

## Backlog (deferred — the Planner mines this at the start of every cycle)

- **S5 — Ambient drive audio (engine note, turn-signal tick), default muted with a dash toggle** — still deferred: Web Audio only (no new deps allowed), must be opt-in so it never autoplays, and needs a speaker toggle somewhere on the dash that does not crowd the console.
- **S8 — Persist progress (visited stops / furthest exit) to `localStorage` so a returning visitor resumes** — still deferred: needs a reset affordance so it can't trap someone mid-route. Now interacts with the `?exit=` deep link shipped in cycle 2 — an explicit deep link must win over a stored position.
- **S9b — Mile markers counting down between exits** — carved out of S9: the sign itself shipped in `86d0174`, but small roadside mile markers would need new drawing in `RoadCanvas.drawRoadside`, which is a separate piece of work.
- **S11 — Give each leg its own roadside character** *(new, cycle 2)* — the route already has named legs (School zone, Career highway, Scenic overlook, Pit stop, Destination) but every mile of roadside is identical: the same lamps and delineators. Varying the furniture per leg — e.g. denser lighting through the "city" legs, a guardrail on the overlook, none out in the open — would make position on the route legible at a glance. Touches `RoadCanvas.drawRoadside` only.
- **S12 — Let the odometer read in years, not just miles** *(new, cycle 2)* — the trip computer counts miles, but the route is chronological and every stop already carries a date. Showing the year you are "driving through" next to the odometer would tie the metaphor to the résumé far more directly than distance does. Needs a date on each stop in `route.js` (education/experience already have one; projects do not).
- **S13 — Weather that belongs to the light** *(new, cycle 2)* — with the dusk-to-night palette in, a thin layer of drifting haze or a few passing headlights on the opposite carriageway would make the road feel inhabited rather than empty. Canvas-only, must respect the per-frame allocation guardrail.
